# TypeScript course 2023
_by Ovidiu Latcu_



Repo to follow along during the 2-day Typescript course held by me.

Pre-requisites:
 - you just need `npm` or `yarn`

How to use : 
 - clone this repo
 - run `yarn` or `npm install`
 - run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to make sure everything is setup correctly
 - follow along the course and write code
 - each day code is also in it's own branch, eg: `git checkout day-1-code` etc.


To run, just run `yarn start` which will execute the `index.ts` file and whatever you put in it.
